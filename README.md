# machine-learning-
assignment(1)
Goal
This assignment aims to implement One-versus-Rest (OvR) strategy transforming multiclass classification 
problems to multiple binary classification problems. We use Different models like SVM, LR and Decision
tree.
Introduction
-Logistic Regression was used in the biological sciences in early twentieth century. It was then used in 
many social science applications. Logistic Regression is used when the dependent variable(target) is 
categorical.
-A support vector machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning model that uses classification 
algorithms for two-group classification problems. After giving an SVM model sets of labeled training data 
for each category, they can categorize new text.
-Argmax is an operation that finds the argument that gives the maximum value from a target 
function. Argmax is most commonly used in machine learning for finding the class with the largest 
predicted probability. Argmax can be implemented manually, although the argmax() NumPy function is 
preferred in practice
-Decision Trees (DTs) are a non-parametric supervised learning method used 
for classification and regression. The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable 
by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features. A tree can be seen as a piecewise 
constant approximation.
